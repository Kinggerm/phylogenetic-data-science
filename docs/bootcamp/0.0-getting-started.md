# Getting started

This bootcamp tutorial is not intended to be a starting point for 
learning Python. There are many resources for that which are much 
more in depth. Below I provide a list of links to several modern
tutorials that I think are great.

Instead, this bootcamp is for students who are familiar with Python
but may have not taken a formal class or had recent/modern training 
in Python. The goal is to introduce several core coding concepts that
will be used frequently throughout this textbook, and to ... coding
concepts that reinforce *style*, *uniformity* that will make your 
code easier for others to read and understand, and thus to 
contribute to collaborative coding in the future.
