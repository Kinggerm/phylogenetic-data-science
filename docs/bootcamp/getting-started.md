# Getting started

This bootcamp tutorial is not intended to be a starting point for 
learning Python. There are many resources for that which are much 
more in depth (I recommend the official Python [tutorial] and 
[documentation]). 
Instead, this bootcamp is intended for those who are already proficient
at the command line, and familiar with Python, but may not have
taken a formal programming class or had training in recent developments
in Python. The goals of this bootcamp are to: 

1. provide a refresher on Python basics; 
2. provide a reference for methods that will be employed in this textbook;
3. to reinforce *style* and *uniformity* that will make code easier to read and understand.

### Where to start

If you wish to skip learning about software installation and jump right
into learning Python coding then you can skip lesson 0.0 on 
[software installation], and start with lesson 0.1 as an introduction to
[jupyter notebooks].
