# Diving into Python types

An introduction to basic types in Python is outside of the scope of this
textbook. If needed, I refer readers to the official Python [tutorial].
Instead, this section will focus on describing differences among 
commonly used types and specifically why some types are used over others
in certain situations. As this comes up in coding exercises in the 
textbook this section will be referred back to.



## Mutable versus Immutable
When to use lists versus tuples. Most beginning Python programmers will use
`list` objects much more commonly than `tuple` objects.  

Lists are mutable and Tuples are not. 

Elements can be replaced, added, or removed from lists.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 'a', 'b']
my_list[0] = '1'
my_list.remove('a')
```

Elements CANNOT be replaced, added, or removed from tuples.
```python
my_tup = (1, 2, 'a', 'b')
my_tup[0] = '1'         # raises a TypeError
my_tup = my_tup[:3]     # to mutate create a new tuple to replace previous one.
```

## Hashing, Sets and Dicts
...

## Arrays and DataFrames
...

<!-- ## Numpy arrays -->

```python
arr = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
```

```python
arr = np.arange(4)
```

```python
arr = np.zeros(4)
for idx in arr.shape[0]:
	arr[idx] = idx
```
