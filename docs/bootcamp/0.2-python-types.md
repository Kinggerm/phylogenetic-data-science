# Diving into Python types


:material-star: *Follow along in a binder jupyter notebook:*
[:python-types: python-types.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/eaton-lab/hack-the-planet/HEAD?filepath=notebooks/python-types.ipynb).


An introduction to basic types in Python is outside of the scope of this
textbook. If needed, I refer readers to the official Python [tutorial].
Instead, this section will focus on describing differences among 
commonly used types and specifically why some types are used over others
in certain situations. As this comes up in coding exercises in the 
textbook this section will be referred back to.
