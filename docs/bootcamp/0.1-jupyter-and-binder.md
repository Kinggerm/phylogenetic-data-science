# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are a type of interactive document that combines 
executable code (usually Python, but many other languages are 
supported as well) with rendered text (Markdown/HTML) and other media. 
They serve as a powerful teaching tool for embedding lesson instructions 
alongside code that users edit and execute interactively. 
They are also widely used in research, and for sharing reproducible 
results and workflows.

## Jupyter servers

*But what is a jupyter notebook?* Let's dive a bit deeper into how they 
work. Jupyter notebooks themselves are simply a document (a type of file
with the suffix `.ipynb`) that records the information that is entered
into it. These notebooks are opened and run by *servers*, which are 
programs that send and receive information over a network. This could be
a local network (just within your computer) or a public network 
(i.e., the internet). Jupyter servers work by connecting a notebook, 
as the frontend, to a Python *kernel* (a running session of Python), as 
the backend, communicating information back and forth between the two.
This is the idea behind jupyter notebooks: A Python backend that uses 
a web-interface frontend to receive commands from users and send back 
results, which can then be saved to the notebook file.

*Most of the time*, jupyter notebooks are run locally on a single computer.
Below you can find instructions for installing and running jupyter
locally. But, before we proceed to that, I want to introduce the concept of
using *remote servers* to run jupyter. This is the process of starting 
a jupyter server on a remote machine, where all backend computation will 
take place, but connecting to it through a browser from your local machine.
This may sound a bit complicated, and to some extent it is, but fortunately,
for certain purposes, the process has become very streamlined through 
services such as Binder.

## Binder (remote server)

[Binder] (mybinder.org) is a *free* web service that can be used to run 
a temporary jupyter server accessible from a public URI. Once it is setup
you can simply share the link with anyone and when clicked it will quickly
start a new server and open the notebooks for the user. It is a great way
to share tutorials and lessons for teaching. You can even configure the
servers to install and load the specific software versions that are 
required to run your code (this process is done using `conda`). It has 
some limitations: the servers have only 2 processors available and a limited
amount of disk space and RAM, but the amount is usually adequate for most
simple tutorials. As a developer, it can be a great way to share examples
of your code without requiring wary users to install anything new. 
We will use binder notebooks often throughout this textbook to share 
coding exercises.

## Using jupyter: A binder example

The best way to learn how to use jupyter notebooks is to jump in and 
try one yourself. Click the following link to connect to a binder-hosted 
jupyter notebook. This notebook includes a lesson on the basics of 
editing Markdown and code blocks, switching between the two, executing code, 
and about other options available in notebooks:

## Installing jupyter locally

Now that you are familiar with how notebooks work, you may wish to install
jupyter locally on your machine so that you can get started using jupyter
to learn Python and create notebooks of your own. Jupyter and all its 
dependencies can be easily installed with `conda`:

```bash
conda install jupyter -c conda-forge
```

## Configuring jupyter

Although it is not required, I recommend running a one-time [configuration]
of jupyter which makes it a bit for convenient to use. Call the command 
below to create a jupyter configuration file which will be stored in 
a `.jupyter/` dir in your home directory.

[configuration]: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

```bash
jupyter-notebook --generate-config
```

Now that this file exists you can mostly forget about it, unless you wish
to customize your notebooks in some way. However, a benefit of it existing
is that you can store a password for your server by running the command 
below. This is a measure that adds additional security, and also will stop
jupyter from asking you to use random passwords.

```bash
jupyter-notebook password
```

## Running jupyter locally

Now we can start a jupyter notebook server with the following command. The 
option `--no-browser` is not necessary for everyone. For WSL2 users it will
hide a warning message that would otherwise pop up telling you that it cannot
open a browser automatically from your WLS2 system. Either way, once the server
is running you can open a browser on your own and connect to it by entering the 
URI that will appear in your terminal.

```bash
# move to your home directory, and start a notebook server from here.
cd ~
jupyter-notebook --no-browser
```

If you entered the option above then the notebook will not automatically 
open in your browser. You will simply see some text being printed in 
the terminal. Open a tab in your browser of choice and go to `localhost:8888`. 
This tells your browser a *local address* which is receiving information from
the local jupyter server running on your computer. Specifically, it is 
sending information to port number 8888, the default port used by jupyter.

## Jupyter filesystem interface
As you have seen before, the jupyter interface will show you a view of your 
filesystem, including folder and files, from which you can either select an 
existing file to open, or create a new one. Jupyter notebooks are saved in a 
file format with the suffix `.ipynb`, and these will appear with little 
notebook icons next to them. 


## Stopping the server
When you start a jupyter server in a terminal, you can just minimize that terminal
or stick it in a corner. The server will continue to function for as long as you 
have this server running. When you are done using, and have saved your notebooks, 
you can stop the server by closing it (or interrupt it by pressing 
<kbd>ctrl-c</kbd>). Try this now by clicking on the terminal running the 
server and interrupting it. You can also close the browser tabs that were
open. You can start the notebook server again at any time following the 
same commands be used above.

<!-- 
### Running jupyter-lab from VSCode
Remember that VSCode has a builtin terminal and server capabilities. 
The text editor uses these tools to connect to the Linux Subsystem 
when executing code through the editor that is installed on Linux, 
such as bash or Python. VSCode also uses this capability to make
it very easy to open and edit a jupyter notebook within the text
editor itself, rather than in a browser window.

## Running a jupyter server remotely

*This is an advanced topic that you will likely not use yet as a new user.*

Although binder makes it easy to connect to a free server running in the 
cloud, the process of setting up jupyter to run on one of your own 
servers remotely is not that complicated. This is useful if, for example,
you want to run notebooks from an HPC cluster. This type of 
connection of course requires much greater security than to run 
jupyter on a single machine, since you do not want just anybody to
be able to connect to your jupyter server, which would give them nearly
full access to your machine. The simple solution is to *tunnel* the 
connection through SSH:

```bash
# a server on machine X serving on port 9999
jupyter-lab --ip=$(hostname) --port=9999 --no-browser
```

```bash
# a user on machine Y securely connects to machine X:9999
# creating a tunnel that serves content to Y:9999
ssh -N -L 9999:X:9999 user@hostname.hpc.edu
```

The user would then leave this SSH tunnel open in a terminal on their 
laptop (machine Y) for as long as they want the tunnel connection 
to be established. The user could then open their browser to 
`localhost:9999` and they should have access to the notebook server.

The user can stop the SSH tunnel at any time by closing the terminal and 
the notebook server would continue to run, just with nobody connecting
to it on the other end. When the user wishes to re-connect they simply
need to start the SSH tunnel again and refresh their browser.
