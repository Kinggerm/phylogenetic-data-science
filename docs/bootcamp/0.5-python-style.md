# Python Styles

Python is a scripting language that is intended to be easy to read and write,
and this underlies much of its popularity and growth over the last few 
decades.

Python was designed as a high human-readable programing language;
nevertheless, this programing language is pretty flexible and does not enforce its writing
in certain ways (e.g., upper or lower case for declaring variables). 
For that reason, it is common to find high variability in the style of
writing from one developer to another. The only major constraint found in Python is the mandatory indentation, which is absent
in most modern programming languages.

For this reason, there are some proposed styles that help 
developers write code having in mind its high readability, promoting standardization.
Having a very organized code is important to communicate the purpose 
to other developers or even for yourself. The style guidelines are useful 
for the coding organization, and they are also handy for documenting the code's functionality.

There are two main topics about styling, documentation styling and coding styling.
Both are related, but they count with different style guidelines to follow.


## Documentation styling

### Docstrings
As we saw in function definitions, a documentation string (docstring) 
is used to provide information about 
a piece of code. For any public-facing part of your code, this should 
include sufficient description that a user can understand what the code
is for, how to use it, and what to expect as a result. For private parts
of your code, not intended to be viewed by users, docstrings are still 
incredibly useful. These docstrings are found in functions, classes, and 
modules. Several conventions have been established for writing docstrings.
An example is the [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
convention below. The description of this convention lays out some general
rules to increase the legibility of docstrings.

<!-- #### PEP 257 - Docstring Conventions -->
```python title="PEP 257 - (older) Docstring convention"
def funtion(real=0.0, imag=0.0):
    """Form a complex number.

    Keyword arguments:
    real -- the real part (default 0.0)
    imag -- the imaginary part (default 0.0)
    """
    if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0:
        return complex_zero
    ...
```

### Online documentation
Sphinx, mkdocs, and other tools can be used to build documentation for a 
package, including tutorials, etc. In fact, this textbook was made using 
a version of mkdocs called mkdocs-material. Automated documentation is 
useful because it can be made to update each time you make changes to the 
code.

### Automating documentation
A benefit of automating documentation is that in addition to the documentation
that you write yourself, using Markdown or REST, parts of your documentation
can also be built automatically by extracting information from the docstrings
in your code. This greatly improves the utility of docstrings in the code, 
since they can become searchable mini tutorials to describe the proper usage
of every function in a package.

To automate documentation from docstrings you must properly format the 
docstrings using one of several newer even *more standardized* formats 
have been developed for this purpose. These are useful not only because 
they can be parsed and understood by software, but following these
practices will also make your documentation easier to understand, since users
will recognize the common format it is written in. 

### Examples
The following examples can be interpreted by Sphinx (software).

```python title="Sphinx (RTD) style"
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2):
    """Example function with types documented in the docstring.

    `PEP 484`_ type annotations are supported. If attribute, parameter, and
    return types are annotated according to `PEP 484`_, they do not need to be
    included in the docstring:
    
    :param param1: The first parameter.
    :type param1: int
    :param param2: The second parameter.
    :type param2: str
    :return: The return value. True for success, False otherwise.
    :rtype: [ReturnType]
    """
```

```python title="Google style"
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2):
    """Example function with types documented in the docstring.

    `PEP 484`_ type annotations are supported. If attribute, parameter, and
    return types are annotated according to `PEP 484`_, they do not need to be
    included in the docstring:

    Args:
        param1 (int): The first parameter.
        param2 (str): The second parameter.

    Returns:
        bool: The return value. True for success, False otherwise.
    """
```

```python title="Numpy style"
def function_with_types_in_docstring(param1, param2):
    """Example function with types documented in the docstring.

    `PEP 484`_ type annotations are supported. If attribute, parameter, and
    return types are annotated according to `PEP 484`_, they do not need to be
    included in the docstring:

    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : int
        The first parameter.
    param2 : str
        The second parameter.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if successful, False otherwise.
    """
```

## Coding styling
The coding style is optional but highly recommended. It does not affect the functionality of your code.
For this reason, even if your code is not very friendly in terms of
readability, it still can do a good job.

Some practices may affect the readability of a code subtly; for
example: the maximum length that a line can have (usually people limit it to 79 characters)
or the quotation marks that you used (Black guideline recommends use `"` instead of `'`)
However, some other practices are more commonly avoided because they affect, in a considerable way, the comprehension of the code. One of those cases is the all-in-one-line instructions.

The following snippet is an exampel of code to create a DataFrame that appears
in another part of this bootcamp, but here written in a more condensed way in
a single line. It is still functional, but it is very hard to read and 
difficult debug to some extent.
```Python title="Example of difficult to read code."
import pandas as pd
pd.concat([pd.DataFrame({'Column+one': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'], 'Column_2': ['s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'], 'Column*3': [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]}),pd.DataFrame([['E','n', 4],['F', 'g', 3]], columns=['Column+one', 'Column_2', 'Column*3'])])
```

To avoid this kind of practice, members of the Python community commonly 
update some guidelines. The main resource for styling Python coding is the [official style guide for 
Python code or PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Here is a 
stylized version of this guide: [https://pep8.org/](https://pep8.org/).

There are some tools to help to maintain some styles. 
**Linters** are software that scan code to search for some potential 
inconsistencies with some styling guidelines. One of the most popular linters
for Python is [Pylint](https://pylint.org/) which is fully compliant with 
PEP 8. Formatters are software that not only scan the code to check some 
styling problems but also offer an automatic alternative version following 
some predefined guidelines. One example of this category is 
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). You can try it
out on this simple web service [https://black.vercel.app/](https://black.vercel.app/).

Some of these Linters or Formatters define many of their our guidelines; 
for example, Black is defined by their proponents and developers as a strict
subset of PEP 8.

Developers should keep in mind that code is intended not only 
to make a computer do something but also it is a tool to communicate
some ideas to other developers. It is for this reason that styling can be very
useful. Nonetheless, styling is not a mandatory or a strict rule. Finally, 
it is the decision of each team to agree on what kind of practices they can
incorporate in their coding routine that fit better with their developing 
environment.
