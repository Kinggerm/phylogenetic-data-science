# Python Styles

Python is a scripting language that is intended to be easy to read and write,
and this underlies much of its popularity and growth over the last few 
decades.

## Documentation styling

### Docstrings
A documentation string (docstring) is used to provide information about 
a piece of code. For any public-facing part of your code, this should 
include sufficient description that a user can understand what the code
is for, how to use it, and what to expect as a result. For private parts
of your code, not intended to be viewed by users, docstrings are still 
incredibly useful.

### Online documentation
Sphinx, mkdocs, and other tools can be used to build documentation for a 
package, including tutorials, etc. In fact this textbook was made using 
a version of mkdocs called mkdocs-material. Automated documentation is 
useful because you can make it update each time you make changes to the 
code. 

### Automating documentation
A benefit of automating documentation is that in addition to the documentation
that you write yourself, using markdown or REST, parts of your documentation
can also be build automatically by extracting information from the docstrings
in your code. To do so, you must properly format the docstrings, and thus 
a number of *standardized* formats have been developed. These are useful not
only because they can be parsed and understood by code, but following these
practices will also make your documentation easier to understand, since users
will recognize the common format it is written in. 

#### Sphinx style
See example here or here.

#### Numpy style
Seee examples here. This is the style that I prefer, since it is more human 
readable than sphinx style, and can still be parsed by sphinx.


## Coding styling
As with most languages, Python is flexible in allowing users to write code
in various ways to accomplish the same task. 



Refrase
xIf you ask Python programmers what they like most about Python, they will often cite its high readability. Indeed, a high level of readability is at the heart of the design of the xPython language, following the recognized fact that code is read much more often than it is written.
xOne reason for the high readability of Python code is its relatively complete set of Code Style guidelines and “Pythonic” idioms.
xWhen a veteran Python developer (a Pythonista) calls portions of code not “Pythonic”, they usually mean that these lines of code do not follow the common guidelines and fail to xexpress its intent in what is considered the best (hear: most readable) way.
xOn some border cases, no best way has been agreed upon on how to express an intent in Python code, but these cases are rare.




### PEP 8 - Official Style Guide for Python Code

### Black style
Black is not only a strict subset of PEP 8, but also is an automatic formatter that 

It is an installable package and it also has a online version for testing purposes.
https://black.vercel.app/
The coding style used by Black can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP 8.



### Examples

```py
def get_num_nodes(tree: toytree.Toytree) -> int:
	"""Return the number of nodes in a tree.

	Example
	-------
	>>> tree = toytree.rtree.rtree(10)
	>>> print(get_num_nodes(tree))
	"""
    return len(tree.idx_dict)
```
