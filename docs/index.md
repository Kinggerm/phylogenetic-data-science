# Phylogenetic Data Science

Welcome to **Phylogenetic Data Science**, a *draft on-line textbook* for 
learning computational phylogenetics through interactive coding exercises 
in Python. A goal of this textbook is to introduce a new generation of 
students to algorithms used in phylogenetics and population genetics 
for studying evolutionary relationships from phylogenetic trees, 
and to introduce these concepts through a data-driven approach geared 
towards treating phylogenetics as a form of data science.


### Ethos
- **free:** all resources are available free and on-line.
- **easy:** coding exercises can be run on cloud-based servers using any 
computer.
- **interactive:** learn by doing; equations and algorithms are paired with example
  code.
- **community:** anyone can contribute changes for editorial approval.
- **translatable:** a Python bootcamp and coding exercises aim to demonstrate modern best practices.
- **modern:** chapters reference recent advances and software tools. 
- **organized:** on-line search enables fast lookup of examples and references.
