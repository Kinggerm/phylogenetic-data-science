## Learning objectives
By the end of this lesson you will:

- Know the assumptions that underlie an 'idealized population'.
- Understand the concept of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 


## Genetic variation
Consider a population that has variation at a single gene (A) in the form
of two alleles (A1 and A2) which differ by a single mutation. We may be 
interested in the frequency of the two alleles in this population; how 
much more frequent does one occur relative to the other? If we assume our
diploid population is of size N, then there are 2N gene copies, every one 
of which exists as either an A1 or A2 *allele*. How can we best measure 
the genetic diversity of this population? How many samples do we need? And 
what can we learn about a population by measuring its genetic diversity at 
a single gene? These types of questions are typically considered to be 
within the discipline of *population genetics*, a field that has traditionally
been treated as distinct from *phylogenetics*. However, as we will see, 
developments in recent decades have significantly bridged a gap between
these fields. Major questions in both disciplines, such as predicting
changes in allele frequencies, or estimating divergence times between 
species, can both be modeled as an outcome of genealogical (tree-based)
processes.

The term *allele* above refers to the state of information in a gene 
copy, i.e., its *haplotype*, which arose as a consequence of mutations 
throughout its genealogical history. So far, we have considered only
two alleles in this population. If a new mutation were to arise at a single 
copy of this gene, then we could also consider a third allele, such as A3; 
but for simplicity, we will assume for now that only two alleles exist 
in the population. *In fact, these types of simplifying assumptions are 
the topic of this lesson.*

## Genetic variation and genealogies
Throughout this chapter we will reinforce a clear distinction between 
relatedness of gene copies, which is a reflection of their 
*usually unobservable* genealogical relationships, versus the 
identity of gene copies, such as their allelic state, which is an 
*observable/measurable* character that arose as a consequence of 
mutations occurring throughout their genealogical history.
<!-- and which can be used to infer their genealogy.  -->

Our example above is a clear case of this distinction. All 2N gene copies
share a genealogy in which some are more closely related to others, however,
because there is only a single mutation in the population, there is at most 
enough information to group these gene copies into two groups, and certainly
not enough information to infer their full genealogy. <!-- This topic will 
be reinforced in the coming chapters through the use of coalescent 
simulation software. -->

??? example "Simulate and plot a genealogy and SNP"
	```py
	import ipcoal

	# simulate a coalescent genealogy with a single SNP
	mod = ipcoal.Model(Ne=1000, nsamples=10)
	mod.sim_snps(1)
	mod.draw_genealogy();  # toytree.utils.tree_sequence().draw_tree(idx=0);
	```

## Population genetics
Let's return to our example of genetic variation in a population. A primary
goal of population genetics is to develop models of evolution within
populations that can be used to predict changes in allele frequencies 
over time. Such models can be discrete or continuous in time, and can 
include parameters to describe how individuals live, die, reproduce, and 
interact with each other and their environment. However, as we will see,
there is a benefit to constructing simple mathematical models to describe
evolution in populations, models that include as few of processes and 
parameters as possible, while still being informative. 

In many cases, these simple models can be incredibly powerful for 
describing evolution. Here we will focus on two genealogical models
of evolution within populations, the **Wright-Fisher (WF) process**, and 
the **Coalescent**. The latter is a mathematical approximation of the
former, and so we will first focus on the WF process. 

<!-- The connection 
between these simple "bean bag" models of population genetics, and 
-->




<!--  
### Model assumptions
Before proceeding to the topic of coalescent models and simulation 
techniques, however, it is important to understand fundamental assumptions
underlying these models. For example, 
 -->

### Idealized populations
Amazingly, much of the foundational work in population genetics was developed 
*before we even knew about DNA*, and involved primarily developing 
statistical models that could convert verbal descriptions of evolution 
occurring in populations into probability statements. An important 
basis for this was the application of Mendel's theory of particulate 
(non-blending) inheritance to describe gene copies as discrete units that
are passed from generation to generation, where the probability that
particular gene copies occur more or less in the next generation
is a manifestation of allele frequencies changing over time.

<!-- Mendel showed that genes are discrete units, diploid organisms contain 
two copies at every gene, and that the two copies have equal probability 
of being passed on to offspring through the formation of haploid gametes. 
This simple 
formalized as a probability statement, and used to develop probabilistic 
models.  -->

To formalize this process into a probabilistic model **we need to make 
some assumptions about populations.** 
An *idealized population* refers to a theoretical population that meets 
a particular set of unrealistic but useful assumptions. Most notably, 
that it is *infinite in size*, that it has discrete non-overlapping 
generations, and that the individuals within it are *randomly mating*. 
As we will see, these and other assumptions can be relaxed to allow 
for further insights into their effect on the model. Overall, the 
purpose of these population genetic models is to understand 
how and why allele frequencies (i.e., the relative abundance of A1 versus 
A2) change over time.


### Hardy-Weinberg Expectation
The [*Hardy-Weinberg* equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle) is a statement that **the frequencies of 
alleles (variants at a gene) and genotypes (combinations of alleles within
diploid individuals at a gene) will remain constant** through time in 
an *idealized population* in the absence of <span style="color:red">
selection, mutation, migration, and genetic drift.</span> 

This is not actually a super surprising statement in terms of statistics, 
but more so in terms of evolution. It is identifying that these processes are fundamental to explaining why allele frequencies change over time, and also, 
that the process of *segregation of alleles* during Meiosis (i.e., Mendelian Inheritance) is not expected to change allele frequencies on its own. 
The concept of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium is demonstrated in the figure below:
(1) given some starting genotype frequencies; (2) we can predict the frequency
of their gametes by assuming equal fitness among genotypes; (3) we can then
also predict the probability of formation of new diploids by assuming
random mating of gametes; (4) which leads to a new population of diploids 
at new genotype frequencies.

### Computing HW
In the first cell of the figure above the population is initially not in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We can tell this by looking at the genotype 
frequencies; there appears to be a deficit of heterozygotes compared to 
what you would expect if the population were randomly mating. But what is 
the null expectation for the number of heterozygotes that should exist? 
Well, this is something that Hardy-Weinberg can tell us. A population is 
expected to reach HW equilibrium after just a single generation, no matter 
what its starting allele frequencies are, if it meets the assumptions of 
an idealized population (i.e., infinite in size and randomly mating). 

More specifically, after a single generation the genotype frequencies 
(e.g., A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2) will reach HW equilibrium, despite the fact 
that allele frequencies (e.g., A1 and A2) do not change. In other words, 
the only thing that is changing is the way in which gene copies are 
grouped together into diploids.

This expectation can be computed exactly using probability statements
implemented in Python. Below we will compute the frequencies for each
step in the figure above. (We will use the same genotype frequencies 
but change the allele names to A and B, rather than A1 and A2 to make 
it easier to read).

```python
import numpy as np
import toyplot
```

```python title="initial diploid genotype frequencies"
AA = 0.3
AB = 0.0
BB = 0.7
```

The genotype frequencies of the three possible genotypes are initially 
0.3, 0.0, and 0.7. Each AA parent has two A alleles, each AB parent has 
one A and one B allele, and each BB parent has two B alleles. We describe
the genotypes in terms of frequencies, as opposed to total numbers, since 
the population is infinite in size.

Based on these frequencies we can calculate the relative frequency of A 
and B haploid gametes that will be produced by these diploids. We can
label these frequencies $p$ and $q$, where $p$ is computed as the sum
of the frequency of AA homozygotes plus 1/2 the frequency of AB heterozygotes; 
$q$ is computed as the sum of the frequency of BB homozygotes plus 1/2 
the frequency of AB heterozygoes.

```python title="haploid gametes generated by diploids (given model assumptions)"
p = AA + (AB / 2)
q = BB + (AB / 2)
print(p, q)
```
```py
# 0.3 0.7
```

You might ask, but what if some of the diploids produced more alleles than
others? Well, for that to happen would be a manifestation of either drift 
or selection, both of which we are assuming to be absent from this model. 
This is key to remember.

Now that we know the frequency of alleles in the gametes we can calculate 
the frequency of genotypes formed in the next generation by assuming that 
populations are randomly mating. AA genotypes are formed by the joining of
two A gametes, heterozygotes by an A and B gamete, and BB genotypes by the
joining of two B gametes. So the probability of AA individuals is the 
probability of sampling $p$ twice ($p$ * $p$), heterozygotes are the 
probability of sampling $p$ and $q$ (or $q$ and $p$), and BB homozygotes
are the probability of sampling $q$ twice ($q$ * $q$). Once again, note the 
importance of the assumptions underlying our idealized population for 
this model prediction.
<!-- HW expectation: `p**2 + 2pq + q**2 = 1` -->

```python title="Genotype frequencies of *next* generation of diploids."
newAA = p * p
newAB = 2 * p * q
newBB = q * q
print(newAA, newAB, newBB)
```
```py
# 0.09 0.42 0.48999999999999994
```

Finally, we can put this code together and recreate the plot from above, 
here using `toyplot`.

### Why HW is relevant to phylogenetics
HW is a model for making predictions about allele frequencies in an
*idealized population*.
