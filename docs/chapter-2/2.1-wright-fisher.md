## Learning objectives

## Wright-Fisher Process

### Model assumptions

### Visualizing

### Diploids

## Hardy-Weinberg

### Example


## Model predictions
Relaxing constraints of the HW model allows us to make predictions
for how a population will evolve as an consequence of one or more
evolutionary processes.

### Population size


### Mutation


## Implementing Wright-Fisher

- analytical solutions for very simple models.
- simulations for more complex models
	- forward-in-time simulations with SLiM3. 
	- backwards-in-time (coalescent) simulations with msprime.
