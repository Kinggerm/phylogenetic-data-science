# Trees as data objects


## The Features of a Tree
A tree can be represented in a variety of ways. Its representation can be
visual, as we have seen already in drawings/plots of trees generated with 
graphical tools. But trees can also be represented as a data structure -- 
an object for storing and retrieving information. In fact, trees are widely
used throughout computer science as an efficient data object for working
with hierarchically structured data. Because the evolutionary process 
inherently gives rise to hierarchically structured information in the form
of ancestry, trees are also widely used in biology both as a 
hypothesis/model, and as a data structure for studying and analyzing 
evolutionary data. How can we create a tree data structure, and 
what does that even mean? Let's walk through it.

A goal of representing a tree as a data structure is to be able to extract
information from the tree. So let's start by trying to identify what 
information *can* or *must* exist in a tree object. Look at the
tree drawing below to try to identify its core features.

??? Example "Example code to create simple tree figure"
    ```py
    # generate a random 8 tip ultrametric tree
    tree = toytree.rtree.unittree(ntips=8, seed=123)

    # draw facing downw with node index labels shown
    tree.draw(layout='d', node_labels="idx", node_sizes=18, node_mask=False)
    ```

## Basic Terminology
There are a number of terms that are used to refer to the parts of a tree, 
and this often varies depending on the field of study in which trees are being
used, such as mathematics, computer science, or biology. For example, the
circles in the figure above are usually referred to as **nodes** or 
**vertices**, and the lines connecting these are usually referred to as 
**edges** or **branches**. This terminology is similarly used to describe 
*graphs*, which are similar data objects widely used in mathematics, and 
increasingly in biology as well. 

The most basic and core features of a tree are the nodes and edges.
But, additional data you may have also identified from the tree drawing 
above could include the lengths of edges; the labels of nodes; whether or 
not each node is a tip or root node (i.e., the number of edges connected 
to each node), and perhaps some other features as well. Given that a tree
composes a somewhat heterogenous collection of information, it begs the
question, what is the best way to represent a tree computationally, for the
purpose of performing scientific analyses. 


## Mathematical Terminology
Let's start by describing a tree in mathematical terms, where it is considered
a special type of graph called a [*directed acyclic graph (DAG)*]. This 
simply means it is a graph where edges point from one vertex to another, 
and cannot form a closed loop (the descendant of a node cannot also be its own ancestor). This property of DAGs makes them well suited for representing 
hierarchical data which, by definition, has the same non-looping property. 
(By contrast, a cyclic graph could be used to represent a network of 
roads, or social connections, where loops in the graph are possible.)

In a more syntactic form, a graph (**G**) can be defined by a set of 
vertices (**V**) and edges (**E**). We can refer to the vertices by a set 
of unique names or numbers assigned to each one, so let's 
say `V = {A,B,C,D,E,F}`. Each edge is defined by a pair of vertices, since 
an edge connects two vertices, so we can say `E = {(A,B),(A,C),(C,D),(C,E),(C,F)}`. 
This is a common way in which a tree or graph might be described in a 
mathematical paper. It is a statement, in this case, that six vertices 
exist, and there are five edges connecting them. 
The exact syntax that might be used in a paper, in terms of using 
curly brackets and/or parentheses, may vary, but usually curly brackets are 
used to represent sets of unique items (just like the `set` object type in 
Python). In fact, from looking at this mathematical description you may 
already have started to think of it as Python code, and this is because it
is very similar. So, lets try writing the same thing in Python, here 
using strings as labels for the unique vertices.

```python title="create sets of vertices and edges"
V = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"}
E = {("A","B"), ("A","C"), ("C","D"), ("C","E"), ("C","F")}
```

[*directed acyclic graph (DAG)*]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph

### Nodes
Nodes are referred to by some type of unique label, such as a name or 
number. The *degree* of a node refers to the number of edges that connect
to it. For example, in **G** from above, the node A has degree=3, whereas 
the node C has degree=2. This can easily be computed for each vertex by 
iterating over each item in the edges set.

??? Example "print the degree of each vertex"
    ```python
    for vertex in sorted(V):
        degree = 0
        for edge in E:
            if vertex in edge:
                degree += 1
        print(f"vertex {vertex} has degree={degree}")
    ```

```
vertex A has degree=2
vertex B has degree=1
vertex C has degree=4
vertex D has degree=1
vertex E has degree=1
vertex F has degree=1
```

In DAGs, because the edges are *directed*, the edge `(A,B)` has a different 
meaning than the edge `(B,A)`; only one or the other can exist. Thus, we 
can also refer to the *in-degree* and *out-degree* of each Node as the 
number of edges pointing *to* or *from* the node, respectively. 

??? Example "print the directed degree of each vertex"
    ```python
    for vertex in V:
        in_degree = 0
        out_degree = 0
        for edge in E:
            if vertex in edge[0]:
                out_degree += 1
            if vertex in edge[1]:            
                in_degree += 1
        print(f"vertex {vertex} has in_degree={in_degree}, out_degree={out_degree}")
    ```

```
vertex A has in_degree=0; out_degree=2
vertex B has in_degree=1; out_degree=0
vertex C has in_degree=1; out_degree=3
vertex D has in_degree=1; out_degree=0
vertex E has in_degree=1; out_degree=0
vertex F has in_degree=1; out_degree=0
```

This leads to a simple way of distinguishing several different types of 
Nodes that are associated with different meanings in phylogenetics. For 
example, Nodes that represent extant samples in a phylogenetic tree
have a special meaning. These are the actual observations. All internal nodes,
by contrast, are theoretical constructs representing inferred ancestors, and
whose properties are a consequence of the type of inference model that is 
used to infer the tree. The extant samples in a tree are referred
to a **tip nodes**, or **leaves**. In terms of their degree, tip nodes 
always have `in_degree=1`, and `out_degree=0`. You can see that our graph **G**
has four tips vertices: B, D, E and F. By contrast, **internal nodes** of a 
tree will always have `in_degree=1` and `out_degree>=2`. As an example, 
vertex C in **G** is an internal node that has one ancestor and three 
descendants. 

A **bifurcating** phylogenetic tree is a tree in which every
internal node has exactly two descendants, i.e., `out_degree=2`. In our 
example, the tree is non-bifurcating, because vertex C represents a 
**polytomy**, containing >2 descendants. Finally, the **root** node is defined
by having an `in_degree=0`, since there is no information about its ancestor. 
The *degrees* of Nodes in a graph constrain the types of structures that it
can represent. As an example, a node in a phylogenetic tree *cannot* have 
an `in_degree>1`, meaning that a node would have more than one ancestor in 
the tree. A node with >=2 ancestors is common, however, in a related data
structure called a *phylogenetic network*, which is mathematically similar to
a phylogenetic tree, but with different constraints. 
<!-- What are the minimal types of Nodes that must exist in a phylogenetic tree? -->

### Edges
Although a vertex can vary in the number of connections it forms with other
vertices (its *degree*), *Edges* are simpler: they always connect just one
vertex to another, no more or less. In this way, edges can be represented 
simply as an ordered collection of the start and end vertices of each edge,
as in the set **E** from above. As we will see later, however, we are often 
interested in storing additional information about edges, such as their length,
which can be used as a weight, or confidence score, and this information is
usually stored separately from the edge set.

## Coding Trees
Different approaches to representing trees as computational objects have 
different challenges for storing and working with data about nodes, edges, 
and their metadata. Below are two approaches.

### Tabular data structure
Storing trees as a table has potential benefits over alternative approaches.
For one, a table is very memory efficient. If you have a tree with 1 million
Nodes this could be stored in the space required for storing two columns
of 1 million integers. This fact is taken advantage of in software tools
like `tskit`, which is used to study collections of genealogical trees 
across entire genomes, which can include millions of trees of large 
size. This software is particularly designed for studying genealogies that
represent *linked trees*, a specific problem in which many trees share 
parts (nodes) that are identical. For example, this is common among 
genealogies from regions of the genome that are in linkage disequilibrium.
In this context, a table can store the redundant information among linked 
trees very efficiently. We will learn more about this library and its data 
objects in a later chapter.

While tables can be efficient for storing and studying fixed trees, they 
are not very efficient when the tree structure needs to be mutable, i.e.,
when we plan to modify the tree at various times by adding and/or 
removing Nodes from the tree. Depending on where the new Nodes are placed, 
we would need to increment the labels of each Node to update which ones are 
connected to which. Similarly, if we wanted to re-root the tree, or change 
other attributes such as the edge lengths, many changes to the table would
need to be made. 

<!-- ??? Example "Example code get an edge table from a ToyTree"
    ```py
    # generate a random 8 tip ultrametric tree
    tree = toytree.rtree.unittree(ntips=8, seed=123)

    # get the tree edges as a table (DataFrame) and print
    print(tree.get_edges())

    # OR
    canvas = toyplot.Canvas(width=800, height=400)
    table = canvas.table(tree.get_edges(), bounds=("5%", "50%", "5%", "95%"))
    axes = canvas.cartesian(bounds=("50%", "95%", "5%", "95%"))
    tree.draw(axes=axes);

For example, say we wanted to find the names of all descendants of internal 
Node 10 in the tree above. Using a table this would require multiple lookups
in the table to ask which nodes are directly descended from Node 10, and then 
which are descended from those descendants. In Python, a table would likely 
be stored as an array, ndarray, or DataFrame, where such lookups can be fast 
in absolute terms, but would require multiple iterations over the table, 
making it slow relative to some alternative approaches.

### Tree Data Structure
A common way to store hierarchical data is to use a Tree data structure. 
This can be created in any object-oriented programming (OOP) language where
arbitrary class objects can be created in memory, and *references/pointers* 
among these objects can be created. This approach is particularly common 
in languages like C, Java, and Python.

... TODO


Doing so requires tracing the connections among nodes, from one to the next,
in a certain order. This process, termed a `tree traversal`, turns out to 
be a very common algorithm used throughout computer science. Consequently,
the development of tree data structures have been well studied. For example,
the file system on your computer represents a tree data structure, where 
folders are nested within folders nested within folders. File browsers and 
other computer programs `traverse` the file system frequently, for example 
when looking for files of a certain name or type. This process could be 
accomplished by storing the names and types of all files in memory at once, 
however, it is much more efficient to simply look inside each subfolder at 
a time, as it is visited, during the traversal process. Moreover, if you have
some idea of where the file you are looking for is located, you can start the
search from that location and only files *descended* (nested within) that 
location will be searched. 


edge metadata could be stored in a separate table, recording a value for each 
edge. This is the approach taken when trees are stored in tabular format.
Alternatively, as we will see when coding trees in an object-oriented 
approach, we can take advantage of the fact that phylogenetic trees are 
constrained to have `in_degree=1` (except for the root), and so we can 
actually greatly simplify 

store edge meta

common to store the 







We will find that traversal strategies are a core concept in developing and
using tree-based algorithms. This makes them not only central to certain 
computational methods, but also central to many algorithms used in 
evolutionary biology.

and write traversal functions.
