## Coding practices
This is one of our first in depth coding exercises, so we will start 
relatively slowly, describing the steps that are taken and why. This 
lesson will use concepts from the bootcamp chapters including `types`, 
`style (and type hints)`, and `classes`. 

## Exercise goal
The goal of our exercise is to develop a Node class object that can 
store information of a tree topology (nodes and edges), 

## A Node-based Tree
The entire tree can be stored simply as a collection of Nodes.

 used
to . Here we will benefit from object 
oriented programming, and this lesson will serve to introduce some core
concepts of OOP.

A tree is composed of Nodes and Edges. These could each be represented by 
an object in memory, however, a more common approach when working with 
tree or graph data structures is to simply represent Nodes in memory, and
for Edges to represent the relationships among Node objects.

## Node class 1
We will walkthrough the development of a Node class object for storing 
information in a tree data structure. To describe this development we 
will start with a very simple object and then iteratively add to it to 
build up to a more complex Python class.

**What is a Node?** 
A single Node of a tree can either be a terminal, internal, or root Node, 
as described in the last chapter. 
<!-- A terminal node has no descendants, this is sometimes referred to its 
degree=1 (reference), because it has one edge in (its parent), and no edges
out (no descendants). An internal Node by contrast has degree >= 2, since it
has a parent in addition to one or more descendants. Finally, a root node 
can have degree >= 2, but it does not have a parent edge, only descendants. -->

Each of these can be represented by a Node class object, but they will differ
in their value for an attribute of the object that points to other Nodes
that are either its ancestor or descendants. 

 that simply store other 
objects as its parent and children. Let's start with a simple example.
Each NodeExample class object has a name and dist associated with it. 

```py
class Node1:
    def __init__(self, name, dist):
        # store parameters
        self.name = name
        self.dist = dist

        # default attributes of Node objects
        self.children = ()
        self.up = None
```

This class is very simple, and so not yet very useful. But already we can 
begin to create a tree data structure simply by creating connections among
Node objects. Below we create three Node instances with different names, 
and then edit the `.children` or `.up` attributes to create references 
(pointers) from one to another, such that the node named "A" is parent to
Nodes "B" and "C". 

```py
# create several Node objects
node_a = Node1(name="A", dist=1.0)
node_b = Node1(name="B", dist=1.0)
node_c = Node1(name="C", dist=1.0)

# connect them to setting their children and/or up attributes
node_a.children = (node_b, node_c)
node_b.up = node_a
node_c.up = node_a
```

There is now information not only within each class instance, but there is 
also information we can extract about the relationships among them. Below
this is done within a for-loop visiting each node to print some information
from its attributes:

```py
# now each Node has data (information about itself and its connections)
for node in (node1, node2, node3):
    children_names = [i.name for i in node.children]
    parent_name = node.up.name if node.up else "None"
    print(f"{node.name}, children={children_names}", up={parent_name})
```
```
A, children=[B, C], up=None
B, children=[], up=A
C, children=[], up=A
```

## Node class 2

Now let's make a more proper version this class. This should include a well
formatted docstring, and type hints for all parameters and attributes of the
class. Here we import an interesting new extension called `annotations` which
allows us to reference the new class we are defining as a type hint for 
itself (i.e., the Node class children are also Node class objects).


```py
from typing import Tuple, Optional

class NodeBase:
    """A Node instance that can connect with other Nodes to form a Tree.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        A name string associated with a Node when printed or visualized.
    dist: float
        A float value as the distance between this Node and its parent (up)

    Attributes
    ----------
    children: Tuple
        A tuple of Node instances that are descended from this Node.
    up: Node or None
        A Node that is ancestral to this Node, or None if this Node is root.
    """
    def __init__(self, name: str="", dist: float=0.):
        self.name = str(name)
        self.dist = float(dist)
        self.children: Tuple['Node'] = ()
        self.up: Optional['Node'] = None

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        """Return string representation of the Node relationship"""
        children = [i.name for i in self.children]
        parent = self.up.name if self.up else 'None'
        return f"<Node {self.name}, up={parent}, children={children}>"

    def is_leaf(self) -> bool:
        """Return True if Node is a leaf (i.e., has no children)"""
        return bool(self.children)

    def is_root(self) -> bool:
        """Return True if Node is the root (i.e., has no ancestor)."""
        return self.up is None

    def add_child(self, node: 'Node') -> None:
        """Add a Node as a child to this one."""
        node.up = self
        self.children += (node,)
```

```py
node_a = Node("a")
node_b = Node("b")
node_c = Node("c")
```


## Traversal
A key feature of tree objects is the process of traversal, by which each 
Node is visited in some determined order. Traversal algorithms make it 
possible to calculate information on trees fast and efficiently, typically
by performing calculations on parts of the tree which can be used for later
calculations. Examples of this include `Felsenstein's pruning algorithm`, 
which we will cover later, as an efficient traversal algorithm for calculating
parsimony or likelihood scores on trees (citation). Here we will first cover
a more simple example, showing how traversal provides an efficient method for
calculating the Node coordinate layout for plotting trees.

As a toy example let's extend our Node class object by creating a superclass
-- a class that inherits the properties of the Node class, but also contains
additional attributes or functions that are defined. Here we are using 
the class extending only as a teaching tool, to break up the description of 
this class into smaller chunks. However, we will later see examples where 
...
This class will have the same `__init__` as the NodeBase, meaning that it
also takes an optional name and dist values.


```py
from typing import Generator
from collections import deque

class Node(NodeBase):
    """Tree is a superclass of Node with traversal functions.

    """

    def _traverse_in_root_to_tip_order(self) -> Generator:
        """Yield all nodes in order of n descendants from root to tips."""
        # start with root in queue. When queue is empty traversal is finished.
        queue = deque([self])
        while queue:
            
            # return the left-most node in the queue. yield returns current
            # state while allowing the func to resume (i.e., a generator).
            node = queue.popleft()
            yield node

            # append the node's children to the right end of the queue
            queue.extend(node.children)

    def _traverse_in_tips_to_root_order(self) -> Generator:
        """Yield all nodes in order by visiting children before parents."""
        stack1 = deque([self])
        stack2 = deque()

        while stack1:

            # pop a node from stack1 and append to stack2
            node = stack1.pop()
            stack2.append(node)

            # append left and right of current node to stack1
            stack1.append()
            if not node.is_leaf():
                queue.extend()
            else:
                yield node

    def _traverse_parents_then_children(self) -> Generator:
        """Yield all nodes in order of parents before children."""
        queue = deque()
        node = self
        while node is not None:

            # attach current node's children to front of queue
            queue.extendleft(node.children[::-1])

            # return the current node
            yield node

            # update node from left of queue
            try:
                node = queue.popleft()
            except IndexError:
                node = None
```

### Create a simple tree
This is a simplified version of a function we used in the last lesson to 
generate a random tree of connected Nodes in `toytree`, using the function
`toytree.rtree.imbtree`. The function below will return an imbalanced tree
by starting with a root Node and adding pairs of children iteratively to 
the right descendant Node until the number of connected tip Nodes reaches
the requested number (ntips). It also extends the `dist` attribute of the 
left child Node each iteration 

```py
def ladder_tree(ntips: int):
    """Return a ladder-like tree of Node objects."""
    # create root Node and select it as current focal node
    node = root = Node(name="root")

    for idx in range(0, ntips, 2):
        # add two children to the focal node
        node.add_child(Node(idx, dist=1))
        node.add_child(Node(idx + 1, dist=1))

        # make right child the new focal node
        node = node.children[1]
    return root
```



```py
for node in 

```
