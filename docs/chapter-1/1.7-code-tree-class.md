# The ToyTree class

In the last lesson we developed a `Node` class object that is similar to
the `toytree.Node` class, and which is used to represent a tree data 
structure. In this chapter we will develop another class that is closer 
in design to the `toytree.ToyTree` class, and which is used to represent
an entire tree. This will help to illuminate how to use the `toytree` library
more effectively, while also demonstrating some coding practices that can 
be useful in many other contexts.

## Learning objectives
By the end of this chapter you will:

1. learn about caching and measuring the speed of Python code.
2. understand the difference between the `toytree.Node` and `toytree.ToyTree` classes.
3. be able to extract Node coordinates to draw a tree from a Tree object.

## Caching Traversals
Although we just learned that tree traversal algorithms are widely useful 
for working with tree data structures, I am now going to going to argue a
slightly contrary point, which is that for the purpose of writing 
super-efficient Python code, you should try to limit the use of tree 
traversals as much as possible. 

This is to say, if a tree isn't changed in some way (e.g., by modifying the 
topology or edge lengths), then a single tree traversal can be performed to 
*cache* the information about the tree structure (e.g., a specific traversal 
order), and any subsequent operations can make use of this cached information 
rather than traversing the entire tree again. This can make code run much
faster since fetching information from a cache (e.g., a dictionary) is 
pretty much the fastest thing you can do in Python; much faster than 
traversing an entire tree. Of course, if the tree *does change* in some way
(e.g., it is re-rooted) then a tree traversal will need to be performed to 
learn the new structure and update the cached information again.

To make this point more clear, let's walk through an example. Let's say that
we want to access the names of every leaf Node in a tree of connected Nodes. 
In the previous chapter we wrote a function in our `Node` class that can do 
this by performing a tree traversal and yielding the names of leaf Nodes as 
they are visited. The speed of this operation is the speed of traversing the
entire tree. I'll first re-use our code from the last chapter to generate
a random tree of Nodes.

# example: iterate over tree traversal to get names of all tip Nodes.

print(root_node.get_leaf_names())
```
```py
# ('left5', 'right5', 'left4', 'right4', 'left6', 'left7', 'left9', 'right9', 'left8', 'right8')
```

To measure the speed of this code we can use the `%%timeit` magic command as 
the first line of a code block in an interactive Python session (e.g., in 
jupyter). This will run the function many times iteratively and report the
average time it takes to complete. On my computer this function takes about
7 µs (microseconds).
```py
%%timeit
root_node.get_leaf_names()
```
```py
# 7.08 µs ± 117 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100,000 loops each)
```

Now let's compare this to the speed of fetching the names of the tip Nodes 
from a cached collection. As we will learn more about soon, `toytree.ToyTree`
objects store a dictionary to cache a reference to every Node according 
to a label representing the order in which it will be visiting using the
*idxorder* traversal. In other words, it stores a dictionary that looks like
this `{0: Node(A), 1: Node(B), 2: Node(C), ...}`. This dict is stored and 
reused for many purposes that require fetching information about one or more
Nodes.

So let's start by creating a dictionary like this, which can be done in a 
number of ways. This example uses the builtin `#!python enumerate` function, 
which returns a generator that yields tuples for each element in an iterable
where the first element is an increasing counter from 0-nitems. Explore this 
function if you are not familiar with it, because we will use 
`#!python enumerate` frequently. A dict is constructed by passing this 
generator of tuples to the `#!python dict` function.

```py
# create a dictionary to cache a reference to each Node
idx_dict = dict(enumerate(root_node.traverse("idxorder")))
idx_dict
```
```py
# {0: Node(left5),
#  1: Node(right5),
#  2: Node(left4),
#  3: Node(right4),
#  4: Node(left6),
#  5: Node(left7),
#  6: Node(left9),
#  7: Node(right9),
#  8: Node(left8),
#  9: Node(right8),
#  10: Node(left3),
#  11: Node(right3),
#  12: Node(left1),
#  13: Node(right7),
#  14: Node(right6),
#  15: Node(left2),
#  16: Node(right2),
#  17: Node(right1),
#  18: Node(root)}
```

Now let's compare how long it takes to fetch the tip Node names from this dict.
The values were stored using a reference to their order in an *idxorder* 
traversal, which we will refer to as a Node's index (`idx`). We know that for
a tree with 10 tips the idx 0-9 will be the tip Nodes, since *idxorder* is
a traversal that visits all tips before internal Nodes. Therefore, we just 
need to fetch the first 10 Nodes. As you can see below, this operation
takes only 546 ns (nanoseconds), which is equivalent to 0.546 µs, making it 
approximately 13X faster than using a traversal! That's pretty dramatic. 
The degree to which caching is faster than traversing will also increase 
very fast as the tree becomes larger, since both operations scale linearly 
with tree size.

```py
%%timeit
[idx_dict[i] for i in range(10)]
```
```py
# 546 ns ± 11.7 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
```

## Trees versus Nodes
The significant difference between the speed of fetching Node data 
cached in a dictionary versus traversing a tree to find a specific set of
Nodes underlies the core reason why the `toytree` library uses two separate
class objects, `toytree.Node` and `toytree.ToyTree`. The former represents 
individual Nodes, just as we have been working with until now. The `ToyTree` 
class, by contrast, is intended to represent an entire tree (a fixed 
collection of Node objects), referenced by its root `Node`. When a `ToyTree` 
is initialized it creates a cached dictionary to store references to the Nodes
in *idxorder*, and it reuses this cached dictionary to perform many tree-based
operations much faster than could be done by traversal with `Node` objects. 
Thus, as you will see, the `ToyTree` class contains many more functions than 
the `Node` class for working with trees, to fetch tree info, perform 
statistical analyses, create tree drawings, and modify the tree data 
structure (by editing Node attributes and then updating the cached Node info).
This distinction between `Node` and `ToyTree` class objects was a design 
decision for making code faster and more organized, and to separate code that
is used to build trees (Nodes) from code that is used to study trees (Trees).

## Tree Class
To better understand this, we will walk through the development of a simple
`Tree` class object in this tutorial that is similar to `toytree.ToyTree`, 
just like our `Node` is analagous to `toytree.Node`. 


```py
from typing import Iterator

class Tree:
    """A Tree is a collection of Nodes with cached traversal data.

    This cache will be auto-updated if the tree topology is changed.

    --------

    >>> tree = Tree(treenode)
    >>> print(tree)
    """
    def __init__(self, treenode: "Node"):
        self.treenode = treenode

        # attributes to be filled: cached traversal data
        self.nnodes: int = 0
        self.ntips: int = 0
        self._idx_dict: Dict[int, 'Node'] = {}

        # run caching of Node data.
        self._update_cache()

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        """Return a representation of the tree as a string."""
        return f"<Tree ntips={self.ntips}>"

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> "Node":
        """Return a Node by its cached idxorder label (idx)"""
        return self._idx_dict[idx]  

    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator["Node"]:
        """Return an iterator over Nodes in idxorder."""
        return (self[i] for i in range(self.nnodes))

    def _update(self) -> None:
        """Set Tree attributes nnodes, ntips, _idx_dict, and set Node._idx.

        This function must be called anytime the tree structure is modified
        by including it at the end of a function that modifies the tree.
        """
        # reset values
        self.nnodes = 0
        self.ntips = 0
        self._idx_dict.clear()
        
        # iterate in idxorder to set Node.idx attributes and counters
        for idx, node in enumerate(self.traverse('idxorder')):
            node._idx = idx
            self._idx_dict[node._idx] = node
            if node.is_leaf():
                self.ntips = idx
        self.nnodes = idx
```

Our simple `Tree` class object has a few special class methods that we have 
not seen before. This includes the `__getitem__` and `__iter__` dunders 
which we'll discuss in a minute. But first, focus on the `__init__`. Our
`Tree` class requires a Node as an input argument, which it stores as an 
attribute called `.treenode`. It then also creates three attributes 
(`.nnodes`, `.ntips`, and `._idx_dict`) that are initially set to default 
values. Finally, at the end of `__init__` another function named 
`_update()` is called. If we follow down through the class definition
we can find this function's definition. It performs a single tree traversal
and as it iterates over Nodes it stores a reference to each in a dictionary
named `._idx_dict` (stored as a private attibute of `Tree`), and it increments
the `.nnodes` and `.ntips` values as counters. Thus, we now have a cached
dict that can be used to reference each Node, and we know how many nodes and
tips there are in the tree.

```py
# get the root Node of a collection of Nodes
root_node = get_random_tree(ntips=10, seed=123)

# get a Tree that stores the Node as its root.
tree = Tree(root_node)
print(tree)
```

```py
# <Tree ntips=10>
```

### Indexable class
One really cool feature of having the Node traversal data cached to our 
object is that we can now fetch Nodes from the `_idx_dict` dictionary by 
using their unique key labels. Here we purposefully used the *idxorder* 
traversal because it has the feature that we know Nodes 0-ntips are the 
tips, and that the final node (nnodes) will be the root. To make our `Tree`
object even more sleek, we have added a `__getitem__` function to it, which
is a special class function in Python that allows an object to be *indexed*,
just like a dict or list. This means we can use square brackets to enter an 
index key to it. Within the `__getitem__` definition we can tell it to do
anything we want to find the value to return. Our function simply tells it
to return the value from the `_idx_dict` attribute that is paired with the 
entered key. The reason we defined the `_idx_dict` to be a private attribute
is because indexing provides a cleaner alternative method for indexing from 
this cache.

```py
# get and print the tip Nodes
print([tree[i] for i in range(tree.ntips)])
print([tree[i] for i in range(10)])

# get and print the root Node
print(tree.treenode)

# get and print all nodes in idxorder (topogically sorted)
print([tree[i] for i in range(tree.nnodes)])

# get and print all nodes in reverse idxorder (topogically sorted)
print([tree[i] for i in range(tree.nnodes)[::-1]])

# get a specific Node by its idx label
print(tree[5])
```

### Iterable class
As we saw above, iterating over cached objects in a dict is much faster than
repeating a traversal algorithm. For most purposes, our main concern is 
whether the order of Nodes is topologically sorted, meaning that parents will
come before children, or vice versa, The cached *idxorder* has this feature, 
and can be iterated over in either direction, start to end, or end to start,
to visit each Node in either topologically sorted direction. As another 
convenient design feature of our `Tree` class I have added an `__iter__` 
method, which allows an instance of this class to act as a generator. Within
this function I use a generator comprehension to return an iterator over 
all Nodes in *idxorder*. Thus, we can also iterate over the cached Nodes using
the very concise syntax below:

```py
# Iterate over cached Nodes in idxorder (faster than true traversal)
for node in tree:
    print(node)
```


## Tree Class (Advanced)
One example of this is Node heights. Calculating heights seems simple, it 
is just the sum of edge lengths from the root Node, right? Well, in an 
**ultrametric tree** (all tips are aligned) that would be true, however, not 
all trees are ultrametric. If tips are different distances from the root
then heights must be measured relative to the tip that is farthest from the 
root. This requires at least two iterations through the tree, one to 
calculate distances from the root, and another to set the new height values
on each Node. Not too complicated. But, as we just stated, there is no 
reason to perform two *traversals*, since we can cache an ordered reference
to Nodes after the first traversal, and then just reuse that information.

This is the strategy in the `ToyTree` class. In fact, from the last chapter
you may remember that *levelorder* and *idxorder* traversals require storing
Nodes in a stack and then unpacking the stack to yield them in a specified
order. Thus, this traversal actually already visits each Node twice. Therefore,
we can add some additional code to this traversal method to allow it to 
calculate and store additional information *while it is already performing
this traversal*. An example of this is in the code below, where we define a
new modified version of the `Node` and `Tree` classes such that the `Node`
now has two additional attributes for storing Node coordinate positions
(`height` and `x`). 

```py linenums="1"
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name: str="", dist: float=1.):
        self.name = name
        self.dist = dist

        # attributes to be updated.
        self.up: Optional['Node'] = None
        self.children: Tuple['Node'] = ()
        self._idx: int = 0
        self._height: float = 0.
        self._x: float = 0.


class Tree:
    def __init__(self, treenode: 'Node'):
        self.treenode = treenode

        # attributes to be filled.
        self.ntips: int = 0
        self.nnodes: int = 0
        self._idx_dict: Dict[int, 'Node'] = {}

        # cache Node idxorder info
        self._update()

    # def ...
    # ... the other definitions from Tree class above could go here...

    def _update(self) -> None:
        """Set and cache Node idxorder and coordinates.

            node = outer_stack.pop()

### *Private attributes*
These are termed private or hidden because they are not intended to be 
accessed by a user. The single underscore at the beginning of their name 
indicates this; stay away. It is further exemplified within interactive 
environments, like a jupyter notebook, where using tab-completion
to view attributes and functions associated with an object *will not show
private attributes and functions* by default, unless you begin to type the
underscore. 

Why create private attributes and functions? There are two good 
reasons: (1) to only show users the code that they are intended to use; and
(2) to limit or specify how a user can modify an object.


### Node class (constrained)
Let's start by creating an example Node object that uses the `@property`
decorator, and which only defines private attribute names in the `__init__`.
Remember that all attributes of a class should be defined in the `__init__`
function. So how will a user access data for this Node is all of its 
attributes are private? The answer is to use properties, which is easiest to
do using the `@property` decorator. 

The user will now be able to see `NodeExample1.name`, which looks like an 
attribute, but is actually a property. It will return the `_name` attribute
when called, and will call the associated *setter* function if the user tries
to assign a new value to the property. This latter usage is perhaps the most
important. It provides an opportunity to intercept the value that the user
wants to assign to the property and to check it for various requirements 
before assigning it to the associated private attribute. For example, if 
a user tried to call `node.name = 3` the setter function here intercepts the
input value and converts it to a string by using the `str()` function before
assigning it to the `node._name` attribute.

```py

class Node1:
    """A simplified version of toytree.Node used here for demonstration."""
    def __init__(self, name: str=""):
        self._name = name

        # non-init attributes for storing connections among Nodes   
        self.up: Node = None
        self.children: Tuple['Node1'] = ()

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value: str) -> None:
        self._name = str(value)
```

So we now have an improved method for setting the name of a Node, which will
ensure that the value is always a string. What else can we use properties for?
In `toytree` we use this framework to purposefully make Node objects immutable,
meaning that do not want users to edit the attributes of Node's directly, 
for example by editing which Node is the parent of another. An example of this
would be the following:
```py
node1 = Node1('1')
node2 = Node1('2')
node3 = Node1('3')
node1.children = [node2, node3]
```

The above operation is allowed using the simple Node class that we developed 
in the previous lesson. However, this is not a good operation, since the 
references among the objects is not complete. node1 has a reference to its 
two child Nodes, however, the child nodes do did not set node1 as their 
parent (`._up` attribute). One way to restrict users from making this error
is to *only allow* them to modify .children or .up using functions that are
designed to ensure that they are set appropriately. 

```py

class Node2:
    """A simplified version of toytree.Node used here for demonstration."""
    def __init__(self, name: str=""):
        self._name = name

        # non-init attributes for storing connections among Nodes
        self._children: Tuple[Node] = ()
        self._up: Optional[Node] = None

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value: str) -> None:
        self._name = str(value)

    @property
    def children(self) -> Tuple[Node]:
        return self._children

    @children.setter
    def children(self, value: Tuple[Node]) -> None:
        raise TypeError("'children' attribute does not allow item assignment")

    @property
    def up(self) -> Node:
        return self._up

    @up.setter
    def up(self, value: Tuple[Node]) -> None:
        raise TypeError("'up' attribute does not allow item assignment")

    def add_child(self, node: Node) -> None:
        """Add a Node as a connected child to this Node."""
        node._up = self
        self._children += (node, )
```

Now to assign a child the user *must* use the `add_child` function, which
ensures that when a child is added the connections are made from both parent
to child, and child to parent. If the user has an advanced understanding of 
the Node2 class they can of course work around this solution by modifying the
hidden `._up` and `_children` attributes, but in that case they know that they
are editing attributes that were purposefully not exposed to the user, and so
should not be surprised if they potentially encounter unexpected outcomes.

### Private functions
We may similarly wish to develop private functions. This is useful for 
functions that are for internal use by the developer, but are unlikely to 
be useful to users. By hiding them from the user it will present a more 
user-friendly object that directs them to use it in the best way possible.

### An immutable Node class
Have a look at the `toytree.Node` class object from the current `main` branch
of `toytree` on GitHub. You can see that it follows the principle we can 
developed above but with a few additional private attributes. Most 
importantly, this includes the `.height` attribute of a Node. 

### Unique node labels (idx)
A set of connected Nodes can only be accessed by their traversal currently,
or by data assigned to nodes, such as name attributes. We have learned how to 
use properties to limit how users assign values to a single object, but what
if we want to assign data to a Node that takes into account the data of all
other connected Nodes? An example would be assigning a unique number to 
every Node to serve as a label. ...

### The ToyTree class object
As we've discussed previously, a tree-like structure can be represented 
simply by the connections among Node objects, so what use is there in 
creating a separate Tree class object? In `toytree` this was design choice
was made because we decided there was a distinction in the intended way that
a Tree versus Node object is intended to be used. A Node stores data including
information about its direct edges, whereas a Tree stores information 
about a set of connected Nodes, and has functions meant for operating on 
them as a collection. With this in mind, we created a class object 
called `ToyTree` that is initialized with a `Node` object that represents
the root Node of a tree (whether or not the tree is rooted).

```py
# design expectation
tree = ToyTree(root_node)

# access information about all Nodes connected to root_node
print(tree.nnodes)
print(tree.ntips)
print(tree.get_node_data("height"))

# traverse Nodes in desired order


# edit Node attributes (returns a new tree with modified Node dists)
tree = tree.set_node_data("height", mapping={0: 100, 1: 200})

```
