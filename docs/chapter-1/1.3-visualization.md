A core utility of trees as data objects is for representing hierarchical
relationships among samples, which is often interpreted through visualizations.
This is the case for phylogenetic systematics is concerned with discerning
the evolutionary relationships among clades of organisms. 

## A history of tree visualization

## Drawing a tree
The next two chapters will walk-through how to write a simple Tree class
object in Python, and to develop a simple tree plotting function to draw
a tree topology. This code will be overly simplified on purpose, but is 
similar in concept to the code underlying visualizations in any of the 
libraries described above.

Before we dive into understanding the inner-workings of tree drawing 
algorithms, however, let's first walk through some examples to 
see what is possible using an established tree visualization library in 
Python, by using the package `toytree`.

## The *toytree* library

Throughout this textbook you will become very familiar with `toytree`, which
was developed by authors of this textbook.
