## Notes
- label more things as pitfalls:
	- interpreting unrooted trees wrong.
	- interpreting lineages as "basal" or "early branching" as ancestral. (Omland, Cook and Crisp).

## Understanding evolution
The term *tree thinking* was coined by Baum, Smith, and Donovan [^1], and
elaborated by Baum and Offner [^2], and Baum and Smith [^3], as a conceptual
framework for teaching and studying evolution. It harkens to Darwin's 
description of evolution by natural selection as a process of "descent with
modification" [^4] by highlighting the importance of the "tree-like" 
structure of the evolutionary process -- tracing descendants back to their
common ancestor -- as a way to communicate and understand evolution.

## Evolution in and on trees
The philosopher of science Robert O'Hara stated *"It is impossible to really
understand evolution without an ability to accurately interpret 
phylogenetic trees"*, and that *"evolution itself is a theory of 
evolutionary trees"* [^5].

He argued that *tree thinking* represents an alternative to *population 
thinking*, in which ...

Tree thinking recognizes that species are not  independent replicates  within a class (as earlier group thinkers had tended to see them), but are instead  inter- connected parts of an evolutionary tree. It lays emphasis on the explanation of evolytionary  events in the  context of a  tree, rather than on the  states exhibited by collections of species, and it  sees evolutionary history as a story of divergence rather than a story of development.

Most people have seen a phylogenetic tree, whether in a museum, on a 
television program, or in the news; but what does a phylogenetic
tree represent? And why is it important to understand? There are actually
several common pitfalls that one can fall into when reading phylogenetic 
trees without a having spent time considering their meaning. Recognizing 
these mistakes will make you a better biologist. 

These errors can often persist even among practicing evolutionary biologists.

We'll cover some of 
these pitfalls in this notebook. One of the best ways to learn to and test
your understanding of phylogenetic trees is through visualizations.

### What is represented at the tips?

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <h3>Box 1:</h3> 
    
Look at Figures 1-3 in the paper by Baum and Offner. In this paper they are describing how to teach literacy in reading phylogenetic trees. What are they trying to depict through these three figures? Why is this a useful approach to teaching phylogenetics?

## WRITE IN A NOTEBOOK BELOW...

## Common ancestry

<!-- Feeback from class:

- move discussion of basal trichotomy to later newick chapter.
- discuss using terms 'basal', and suggest using 'sister'
- discuss how a tree represents what is sampled, and not what is missing.
	- internal node is an ancestor of the samples, but probably also of many others not sampled.
- more about using outgroups. What if they are hard to find, or too distant. use midpoint.
- later in the ML section perhaps talk more about midpoint rooting, and rate diffs.
- maybe make your own version of Figure 1-2?
 -->

### Terminology

Trees, undirected cyclic graph.


Edges, branches, ...


Nodes, vertices, ...


### Rotation


### Rooting


### Units
What are the units of branch lengths in a tree? As we learned in chapter 1.1, 
trees can be used to represent many different things, and so there is no one
answer for this. 


### Tree shapes

Special shapes: 
	- caterpillar or ladder tree.
	- balanced tree
	- fan, comb, or unresolved tree.

Random trees.
	- 

### Tree shapes as data
- analysis of tree shapes using ABC for ...
- analysis of tree shapes for diversification ...

This methods seem to have fallen out of favor, as they are less commonly
employed as more powerful statistical methods have been developed for testing
hypotheses about diversification rates (cite), and further statistical 
developments have highlighted challenges to simpler methods in distinguishing
between alternative hypotheses for observed patterns of trees.
