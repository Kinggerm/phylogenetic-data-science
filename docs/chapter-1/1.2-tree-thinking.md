### Tree shapes

Special shapes: 
	- caterpillar or ladder tree.
	- balanced tree
	- fan, comb, or unresolved tree.

Random trees.

### Tree shapes as data
- analysis of tree shapes using ABC for ...
- analysis of tree shapes for diversification ...

This methods seem to have fallen out of favor, as they are less commonly
employed as more powerful statistical methods have been developed for testing
hypotheses about diversification rates (cite), and further statistical 
developments have highlighted challenges to simpler methods in distinguishing
between alternative hypotheses for observed patterns of trees.
