## Understanding evolution

The term *tree thinking* was coined by Baum, Smith, and Donovan [^1], and
elaborated by Baum and Offner [^2], and Baum and Smith [^3], as a conceptual
framework for teaching and studying evolution. It harkens to Darwin's 
description of evolution by natural selection as a process of "descent with
modification" [^4] by highlighting the importance of the "tree-like" 
structure of the evolutionary process -- tracing descendants back to their
common ancestor -- as a way to communicate and understand evolution.

## Common ancestry




### Terminology

Trees, undirected cyclic graph.


Edges, branches, ...


Nodes, vertices, ...


### Rotation


### Rooting


### Units
What are the units of branch lengths in a tree? As we learned in chapter 1.1, 
trees can be used to represent many different things, and so there is no one
answer for this. 


### Tree shapes

Special shapes: 
	- caterpillar or ladder tree.
	- balanced tree
	- fan, comb, or unresolved tree.

Random trees.
	- 

### Tree shapes as data
- analysis of tree shapes using ABC for ...
- analysis of tree shapes for diversification ...

This methods seem to have fallen out of favor, as they are less commonly
employed as more powerful statistical methods have been developed for testing
hypotheses about diversification rates (cite), and further statistical 
developments have highlighted challenges to simpler methods in distinguishing
between alternative hypotheses for observed patterns of trees.
