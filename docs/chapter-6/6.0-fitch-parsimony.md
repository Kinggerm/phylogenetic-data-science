# Tree Inference (Parsimony) (TO BE UPDATED)

:material-star: *Follow along in a binder jupyter notebook:*
[:material-notebook: fitch-parsimony.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/eaton-lab/phylogenetic-data-science/HEAD?filepath=docs%2Fchapter-6%2Fnotebooks%2Fparsimony.ipynb)

## Learning objectives
Before starting this chapter I recommend reading 
[chapter 5](../6.0-tree-inference.md) for an introduction to phylogenetic 
inference. By the end of this chapter you will:

1. Understand how the principle of parsimony is used in phylogenetic tree inference.
2. Be able to write and write a function to calculate a parsimony score.
3. Know the difference between Fitch and Sankoff parsimony algorithms.


## The principle of parsimony
The principle of parsimony, also termed [*Occam's razor*], is widely used in
biology. It advocates that when presented with competing hypotheses about the 
same prediction -- such as different phylogenetic hypotheses for a set of 
samples -- one should select the solution that requires the fewest 
assumptions. In evolutionary terms, this is often interpreted to mean that 
the most *parsimonious* solution is the one that requires the fewest 
observed evolutionary changes.

[*Occam's razor*]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor


## Maximum parsimony
Finding the most parsimonious tree given a phylogenetic dataset thus 
requires, most importantly, an algorithm for counting the number of 
evolutionary changes on a phylogenetic tree. This turns out to be 
relatively simple to code algorithmically, but can be quite complex in
terms of the underlying philosophical and statistical interpretations
of what these changes mean. A subject we will return to later. Here we 
will focus on the algorithmic methods for *counting evolutionary changes*, 
by introducing two algorithms, *Fitch parsimony* and *Sankoff parsimony*. 

We will refer to the number of inferred evolutionary changes on a tree, 
given a dataset, as its *parsimony score*. With a parsimony algorithm 
in hand, we could in theory compute the parsimony score for every possible
tree topology to find one or more trees requiring the minimum number of 
changes. Because the total number of trees possible is typically
far too large to compute on, [heuristic search] methods are usually 
employed instead, which score only a subset of trees. This will also be
covered in a later chapter. This general approach, of comparing parsimony scores 
on many trees to find the best scoring tree is termed *maximum parsimony (MP)*. 

[heuristic search]: .

### Phylogenetic data
As with most phylogenetic inference algorithms, parsimony is intended to 
apply to discrete character measurements, such as binary data 
(`0` or `1`) or multistate characters (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C` or `D`). We discuss
discrete data in much detail in [chapter 3]. Parsimony can be applied to DNA
sequence data, and is frequently used alongside other methods for analyzing
DNA, such as likelihood and distance-based inference methods. However,
the *niche* where maximum parsimony remains most commonly used today, is in 
the analysis of morphological datasets, especially in paleontology,
where DNA sequence data is often not available.

[chapter 3]: . 

### Characters on a tree
Let's start with a simple example where we have measured a single
discrete binary character for five different species, and we want to 
examine this character with respect to a particular phylogenetic 
hypothesis. We will make the assumption that the character can only be in
one of two possible states, and thus that the only possible evolutionary
changes are from `0 -> 1` or `1 -> 0`. We only have data for the tip
samples, but from these data we can infer the states of ancestral nodes
in the tree, tracing back all the way to the root.


```py
import toytree

# an example five tip tree (with tip names alpha-epsilon)
tree = toytree.tree("(((alpha,delta),gamma),(beta,epsilon));")

# a single example binary trait for species alpha-epsilon
trait = {
    "alpha": 1,
    "beta": 0,
    "delta": 1,
    "epsilon": 0,
    "gamma": 1,
}
```

We can easily visualize this trait in `toytree` by setting it as attribute
data on the Nodes, for example by using the `set_node_data` ToyTree function.
We can then get and show the data as a dataframe using `get_node_data`. 
Here you can see the `idx` label of each Node as the rows, and the name and
trait values for each Node as well.

```py
tree.set_node_data(
    feature="trait",
    mapping=trait,
    inplace=True,
)

print(tree.get_node_data(['name', 'trait']))
```

??? Example "Trait dataframe"
    |    | name    | character   |
    |---:|:--------|:------------|
    |  0 | alpha   | 1           |
    |  1 | delta   | 1           |
    |  2 | gamma   | 1           |
    |  3 | beta    | 0           |
    |  4 | epsilon | 0           |
    |  5 |         |             |
    |  6 |         |             |
    |  7 |         |             |
    |  8 |         |             |


Our current knowledge is only of the data at the tips, which looks like
this on our tree hypothesis:

```py 
# draw tree with tip Nodes colored by feature 'trait' 
tree.draw(
    tree_style='s',
    use_edge_lengths=False, 
    tip_labels_style={"font-size": 18},
    node_labels="trait",
    node_colors=[
        toytree.color.COLORS1[i] if i !="" else "lightgrey" 
        for i in tree.get_node_data("trait")
    ],
);
```

### Eyeball Reconstructions
Given that this is a fairly small tree, we can try to estimate 
the number of evolutionary changes by simply eye-balling to count the number
of events that would be required to explain the data at the tips, without
the need for a proper algorithm. Try doing this now. You will likely find
that there are two equally good reconstructions for this character on this
tree topology, which are identical except for the assumption about the 
state of the root Node. In other words, either the root state was `0` and 
transitioned from `0 -> 1` in the common ancestor of *alpha, delta,* and 
*gamma*; or, the root state was `1` and transitioned from `1 -> 0` in the 
common ancestor of *beta* and *epsilon*. 








If we simply 
There are two equally likely reconstructions for this character

```py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# generate an example character matrix as a pandas dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame(
    columns=["t" + i for i in range(6)],
    index=["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon"],
    data=[
        [1, 0, 0, 1, 1 ,0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    ],
)

# display the dataframe
data
```

Our example phylogenetic dataset for multiple binary characters looks
like the following:

|         |   t0 |   t1 |   t2 |   t3 |   t4 |   t5 |
|:--------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| alpha   |    1 |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    0 |
| beta    |    0 |    0 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| gamma   |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| delta   |    1 |    1 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    1 |
| epsilon |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    0 |




which we want to 
use to infer a most likely 



. We will assume
that there are only two possible states for this character, and thus that
the ancestors of these samples, tracing back to their common ancestor, 
have either state `0` or `1`, and that changes along the edges of the tree could
have occurred to change a trait from `0 -> 1` or from `1 -> 0`.

import toytree
import ipcoal
