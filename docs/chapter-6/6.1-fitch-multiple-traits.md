## Character matrix

Most phylogenetic datasets will contain measurements of many traits, and 
so let's now expand our Fitch parsimony algorithm to accomodate such data, 
where the returned score will be the sum of events across each measured 
trait. An example character matrix is shown below, and would typically be 
stored either as a numpy array, or as a Pandas DataFrame. This example 
includes seven binary characters measured across the same five taxa, but a 
data matrix could just as well represent thousands of DNA sites from a 
sequence alignment. Either way, our algorithm should work properly to 
return a score.

```py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import toytree
```

```py
# example five tip tree (with tip names alpha-epsilon)
tree = toytree.tree("(((alpha,delta),gamma),(beta,epsilon));")

# generate an example character matrix as a pandas dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame(
    columns=["t" + str(i) for i in range(7)],
    index=["alpha", "beta", "gamma", "delta", "epsilon"],
    data=[
        [1, 0, 0, 1, 1 ,0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    ],
)

# display the dataframe
data
```

|         |   t0 |   t1 |   t2 |   t3 |   t4 |   t5 | t6  |
|:--------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|----:|
| alpha   |    1 |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0|
| beta    |    0 |    0 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0|
| gamma   |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0|
| delta   |    1 |    1 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    0|
| epsilon |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    1 |    0 |    0|


Here we will also implement a number of shortcuts to speed up calculations
of the parsimony score for multiple characters. For example, we can skip
any data columns that are invariant, such as "t6" in the table above, since
these will have zero events. Similarly, we can skip any columns that have
only a single difference, such as "t5", since we know that regardless of the
tree topology this will require only a 1 event, so can simply count 1 for 
these. Finally, we can reduce the amount of work by counting how many unique
site patterns there are, and only applying our algorithm to these, 
and multiplying the result by the number of times it occured. For example, 
"t3" and "t4" are identical, and similarly, t0" and "t2" are the same, but
simply inverted. 


```py
from typing import Dict, Any


def preprocess_matrix(data: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Return a score and dict of sites to be processed.
    
    This func will remove invariant sites and sites with only a single
    autapomorphy, and will find and return only unique site patterns. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pandas.DataFrame
        A pandas dataframe character matrix with taxon names as index.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict
        A dict with a key 'score' for the number of singleton sites, and a
        key 'traits' for a dict of unique site patterns and their counts.
        Patterns are ordered by the name index in input data.
    """
    # get data as a numpy array
    arr = np.array(data)

    # get int array counting how many samples match the state of 
    # the first sample in each column. We will use this for filtering.
    counts = np.sum(arr == arr[0], axis=0)
    
    # get boolean array of invariant columns, i.e., all items match the first.
    invariant = counts == arr.shape[0]
    
    # get boolean array of singleton columns, i.e., nmaching is 1 or N-1
    singletons = (counts == 1) | (counts == arr.shape[0] - 1)
    
    # combine boolean masks and filter columns from data
    arr = arr[:, np.invert(invariant | singletons)]

    # count the number of singleton sites
    score = singletons.sum()

    # get unique site patterns and their counts
    arr, counts = np.unique(arr, axis=1, return_counts=True)

    # find columns that are the same PATTERN as others. 
    # This part is a bit tricky, see details in text.
    trait_dicts = {}
    for cidx in range(arr.shape[1]):
        
        # get unique site patterns and recode them: [1, 1, 0] -> [0, 0, 1]
        _, idx, inv = np.unique(arr[:, cidx], return_inverse=True, return_index=True)
        order = np.argsort(idx).tolist()
        site = tuple((order.index(i) for i in inv))
        
        # record the first time pattern is seen
        if site not in trait_dicts:
            trait_dicts[site] = counts[cidx]

        # increment following times
        else:
            trait_dicts[site] += 1
    
    # return the score, and traits as dicts with taxon names as keys
    return {"score": score, "traits": trait_dicts}
```

As an example, when we apply this function to our data it is reduces from 
7 sites to only 3 unique sites, two of which occurred twice, and one that
occurred once. In addition, the parsimony score for this matrix is already
1, since there was one site that had a pattern with only one sample different
from the others. 

```py
preprocess_matrix(data)
```

```py
{'score': 1,
 'traits': {(0, 0, 1, 1, 0): 1, (0, 1, 0, 0, 1): 2, (0, 1, 1, 0, 0): 2}}
```

Now we can compute the rest of the parsimony score by 
analyzing these remaining unique patterns on the tree. For this, we can 
use a modification of our function from the last page.
